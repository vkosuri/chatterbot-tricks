Chatbot text into events
========================

Ref: [#482](https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot/issues/482)

Creating efficient scheduling operations can often be a challenging problem to solve. What about offloading the task to the user's calendar? Most calendar apps already display notifications when a scheduled event is coming up, and it would also make it possible synchronize the events across the user's devices if they were all connected to the same calendar.
